# PRODIGY_ML_03
Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

Working on this project provided me with hands-on experience in implementing machine learning algorithms for real-world image classification problems. I explored the following key areas:
   * Image Preprocessing: Learned how to convert raw images into usable numerical data through resizing, grayscale conversion, and flattening.
   * Support Vector Machines (SVM): Understood the working of SVMs and experimented with different kernels to optimize classification performance.
   * Model Evaluation: Gained insights into model validation techniques using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and performance metrics.
